# reinventing_the_wheel

This repository is a learning playground: I "reinvent the wheel" by implementing widely known programs and small systems from scratch to better understand fundamental concepts and low-level details.

## Concept

- Purpose: practice and experiment with core programming concepts by building simple, well-known programs and demos with as little dependencies as possible.
- Approach: write minimal, readable implementations; prefer clarity and learning over production polish.

## What’s implemented

- **HTTP Protocol** — small experiments around HTTP-like protocol handling and simple servers/clients (see `httpprotocol/`).
- **Random Walk** — an Ebiten-based Go demo where multiple agents perform a random walk and leave colored trails (see `randomwalk/`).
- **3D Projection** — a simple 3D projection demo using Ebiten to visualize basic 3D shapes and transformations (see `/projection3D`).

## Some ideas to implement in the future (non exhaustive)

- reimplement hexdump
- A physics simulator
- DNS resolver
- Minimal lisp interpreter

More experiments and small projects may be added over time; each directory contains an experiment with its own README or source files.
